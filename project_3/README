## To run: run `./memSim <reference-sequence-file.txt> <FRAMES> <PRA>` with any command line args you need.

## notes
Our backing store class is built off of the assumption that there is a provided file with the name BACKING_STORE.bin in the directory,

if you want to change the TLB size then you can modify the TLB_SIZE constant at the top of the main_memory.py file

our page table caps at the size of the backing store
