## Instructions:
1. `make clean` 
2. `make`
3. `./scheduler schedule.txt <ALGO NUMBER>`

## Things we want you to know:
- For sorting the tasks (singly linked list) for SJF and SP, we changed the original return types of the scheduling 
  functions to return a new sorted task list. We removed a task one at a time from the original task list and added to the sorted list.
  Therefore, the print task stats function now prints them in the order they were run rather than in order of TID.
- Our implementation is a bit reliant on the fact that each task arrives at time 0.
- Our round robin queue implementation is reliant on the number of tasks not being big or burst time being too long.
- you said those ^ dependancies are fine, we just wanted to outline them here!

## What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? 
- As time quantum lengths increase, the response time will also increase until the quantum length is >= the largest burst time. 
  Once quantum length >= largest burst time, the response time will converge at the response time for whichever algorithm you use
  to break ties (in our case FCFS). For our tasks in schedule.txt, once the time quantum is >= 40, the response time is equal to 
  the response time for the FCFS algorithm.
